# TALA Rescue Next Steps

## Purpose

This is the active planning surface for issue order, compact parent/sub-slice maps, routed deferrals, and the one active approved plan contract. Product behavior and workflow rules remain in their owning authorities. Allocate a new top-level issue after the highest numeric ID already reserved here, in `TALA-Local-Linear-Sync-Tracker.md`, or in Linear; confirm live Linear before creating it.

## Active and Upcoming Issues

Remaining dependency chain: run the post-integration regression gate (TAL-96), then prepare the verified demo and rehearsal environment (TAL-97). Post-MVP deferrals are nonblocking.

| Issue | Status | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAL-96 | Planned | Post-Integration Cross-Role Regression: verify system coherence after CP-SAT and PayMongo are wired in. |
| TAL-97 | Planned | Demo and Rehearsal Support built only from the verified MVP. |

## Active Approved Plan Contract

No active approved plan contract.

## Post-MVP Deferrals

| Issue | Status | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAL-98 | Future; nonblocking | Archival, offline-storage management, and disposal automation deferred from TAL-92E and PRD §13.7. |
| TAL-99 | Future; nonblocking | DPO-owned privacy-request intake and logging deferred from TAL-92F and PRD §13.3.4. |
| TAL-100 | Future; nonblocking | Database-backed configurable notification templates deferred from TAL-92F and PRD §13.1.1. |
| TAL-101 | Future; nonblocking | Database-level audit tamper-evidence hardening deferred from TAL-93A and PRD §13.6. |

### Unapproved Proposals

No work outside the listed issues is approved or implied. Any additional institutional feature, UI plugin, or infrastructure enhancement must pass the protocol gates and receive an explicit Next Steps issue before implementation.

### Next Boundary

Next primary boundary: **Plan TAL-96**. No TAL-96 implementation, Linear sync, push, PR, or deployment is authorized.
